We name them, we worry about them, and we let them wake us up at 4:00 am. Amazon CTO Werner Vogels has dubbed these behaviors as &quot;server hugging&quot; and antiquated in today&#39;s cloud infrastructures. In this breakout session, we will discuss methods and methodology to get away from &quot;server hugging&quot; and be concerned more with the overall status and life of our entire infrastructure. From making use of toss-away-able on-demand infrastructure, to monitoring services and not individual servers, to getting away from &quot;naming&quot; instances, this session helps you see your infrastructure for what it is, technology that you control.</td>

At Adobe, we use AWS CloudFormation to define our infrastructure in AWS as code. By using AWS CloudFormation in combination with other tools, including OpsCode Chef, we are able to create highly flexible and customized workflows that ensure consistent and audited deployments. From our VPCs to our applications, we can build and tear down in a matter of minutes. Come see how we have put the power of AWS CloudFormation to work at Adobe using advanced techniques such as substacks, identity and access management roles, bootstrapping into Chef, and more—including a demo of our automation environment. For us, AWS CloudFormation is the service that ties a pretty bow around all of the other powerful AWS offerings.</td>

Amazon Web Services makes it possible to construct highly elastic computing systems, and you can further increase cost efficiency by leveraging the Spot Pricing model for Amazon EC2. We showcase elasticity by demonstrating the creation and teardown of a petabyte-scale multiregion MongoDB NoSQL database cluster, using Amazon EC2 Spot Instances, for as little as $200 in total AWS costs. Oh and it offers up four million IOPS to storage via the power of PIOPS EBS.  Christopher Biow, Principal Technologist  at 10gen | MongoDB  covers MongoDB best practices on AWS, so you can implement this NoSQL system (perhaps at a more pedestrian hundred-terabyte scale?) confidently in the cloud.

Is your service ready to handle it? Systems are only as scalable as their weakest component. Large scale load testing in production is the best (and surest) way to ensure that services can truly scale to the unexpected. But the load generator itself can be difficult to scale, expensive to run on hundreds or thousands of hosts, challenging to keep the data secure, and time consuming to develop. The Amazon.com retail site is one of most heavily used sites in the world, and has to be ready for anything, at anytime. How do you design a load test for this in record time while keeping it cost effective? Well, you use AWS! Come learn Best Practices on how you can use Amazon SQS, Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, Amazon CloudWatch, Auto Scaling, and Amazon DynamoDB to design horizontally scalable large-scale load tests that can simulate the load that millions of users are putting onto your site. We met a tight schedule and did it under budget thanks to AWS and you can too!</td>

  <td colspan=2 style="padding-left:20px; padding-bottom:10px; font-size:x-small;">Running your Amazon EC2 instances in Auto Scaling groups allows you to improve your application&#39;s availability right out of the box. Auto Scaling replaces impaired or unhealthy instances automatically to maintain your desired number of instances (even if that number is one). You can also use Auto Scaling to automate the provisioning of new instances and software configurations as well as to track of usage and costs by app, project, or cost center. Of course, you can also use Auto Scaling to adjust capacity as needed - on demand, on a schedule, or dynamically based on demand. In this session, we show you a few of the tools you can use to enable Auto Scaling for the applications you run on Amazon EC2. We also share tips and tricks we&#39;ve picked up from customers such as Netflix, Adobe, Nokia, and Amazon.com about managing capacity, balancing performance against cost, and optimizing availability.</td>

  <td colspan=2 style="padding-left:20px; padding-bottom:10px; font-size:x-small;">(Presented by NetApp) NetApp Private Storage for Amazon Web Services represents a new generation of hybrid data center solution that marries public cloud benefits with proven enterprise storage.  Well suited for workloads with variable or unpredictable compute needs that also require a high degree of data stewardship, the solution combines the economics, elasticity, and time-to-market benefits of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) with an agile data infrastructure characterized by the proven performance, availability, security, and compliance of dedicated NetApp storage.&#10;We showcase customer results across a variety of use cases ranging from web and business applications to big data analytics while paying special attention to the benefits of creating a disaster recovery as a service solution for Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP Applications. Disaster Recovery for enterprise applications is a key piece of a robust business continuity strategy, but a traditional solution that requires establishing a redundant infrastructure stack in a remote location can take a big bite out of IT budgets and is sometimes hard to justify.  Using Amazon EC2, AWS Direct Connect, and NetApp storage and data management, customers have achieved cost-effective enterprise-grade data protection and business continuity from on-premises production environments to a single AWS region and across geo-diverse AWS regions.&#10;Blue River demonstrates how to achieve these results using NetApp application integrated Snapshots and asynchronous mirroring to replicate and failover from on-premises infrastructure to EC2 and NetApp in a Direct Connect enabled Equinix colo. When used in combination with AWS Reserved Instances at the failover destination, this solution provides a low cost, reliable Disaster Recovery option with granular recovery points, fast recovery time, and full data control on private storage.  We also show how the DR site can be dual purposed to provide a highly efficient Development and Test environment that accelerates innovation.</td>

Building distributed systems is hard, but our goal in this session is to simplify the complexity of this topic to empower the hacker in you! Have you been bitten by the eventual consistency bug lately? We show you how to tame eventual consistency and make it a great scaling asset. As you scale up, you must be ready to deal with node, rack, and data center failure. We share insights on how to limit the blast radius of the individual components of your system, battle tested techniques for simulating failures (network partitions, data center failure), and how we used core distributed systems fundamentals to build highly scalable, performance, durable, and resilient systems. Come watch us uncover the secret sauce behind Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon SQS, Amazon SNS, and the fundamental tenents that define them as Internet scale services. To turn this session into a hacker&#39;s dream, we go over design and implementation practices you can follow to build an application with virtually limitless scalability on AWS within an hour.

These are often very expensive and procurement cycles quite lengthy. They also need specialized expertise in each vendor&#39;s storage technologies to configure them and integrate them into the ecosystem, again resulting in prolonged project cycles and added cost. AWS provides end-to-end storage solutions that will fulfill all these needs of Enterprise Environments that are easily manageable, extremely cost effective, fully integrated and totally on demand. These storage technologies include Elastic Block Store (EBS) for instance attached block storage, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) for object (file) storage and Amazon Glacier for archival. An enterprise database environment is an excellent example of a system that could use all these storage technologies to implement an end-to-end solution using striped PIOPS volumes for data files, Standard EBS volumes for log files, S3 for database backup using Oracle Secure Backup and Glacier for long-time archival from S3 based on time lapse rules.

The boundary between one application or service and another is often fuzzy, with many interdependencies. These traits make some enterprise applications difficult to refactor and move to a public cloud. Even the teams that manage these applications can be unfamiliar with cloud terminology and concepts. In this session for enterprise IT architects and developers, Brad Schick, CTO of Skytap and Skytap customers Fulcrum, DataXu and F5 will share their insights into why the evolution of enterprise applications will lead to hybrid applications that opportunistically take advantage of cloud-based services.
